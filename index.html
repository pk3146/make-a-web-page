<h1>Basics of Web and HTML </h1>
<p>There are two main sections in this lesson.  The first explains how the internet works and how users,
computers, servers, http, and internet all fit together. In the second, learn how to make HTML tags to
create an HTML document that a browser can display as a web page.
</p> 
  <div> 
  <h2>Part 1: The Web </h2>

  <p>
  Collection of HTML documents and the basis for everything on the web, invented in early 90's and has 30 billion pages
  Major Pieces of Web -- you, computer + browser, internet, server
  Http requests are made from the browser to the server via the internet
  Servers are optimized for sitting in a data center housing files
  Http is a very simple protocol used for communication<br>
  HTML-Hypertext Markup Language <br>These documents are the heart of the web, the are made of text
  content (what you see), markup (what it looks like) and/or references to other documents or links to other
  pages.Check out www.udacity.com/html_playground to experiment<br>
  </p>

	<h2> Part 2: Examples and Basic Descriptions of HTML Tags and Elements</h2> 

  Listed below are a few basic examples that were provided during the lesson to explain the concept of elements and tags.

  Example: Name Contents Name  First is opening tag, last is closing tag and the entire thing is an element

  <br> b tag -- anything inside is bold <br>

	 M tag = emphasis for italic <br>

	HTML Attributes - Connect HTML documents you write to any other document on the internet with links <br> 

	Whitespace - When rendered in html, showed up on same line. To force on multiple lines, use the break (void) ,<br> tag
	OR use the p or paragraph tag. 

	<h3> Inline vs Block </h3> 
  <p> br is inline and p is block.  br is simply ending a line, p tag works differently and is actually making 
  an invisible box. The invisible box can have height and width.  Note, the p element is the only block element we've learned so far.<br>
  Span is inline and div is block.
  </p>

  <h3>Basic HTML Vocabulary</h3><br>
  Tag: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (p for example) and a closing tag, (forward slash p). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the br tag).<br>
	Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.<br>
	Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write a href="www.udacity.com" [note removed tags to view in notes]

<h1> Web Pages, Documents and Structure</h1>
<p>
One of the key concepts to remember is that although HTML and CSS are both languages, they are quite different.  
Think of HTML like the structure of a home (i.e the foundation and walls), and CSS is the style, or decoration within the home.  Every webpage has a structure.  HTML elements are either inline or block.
If they are block, the structure can be broken down into invisible squares. The element div allows you to add structure, sort of
like drawing an invisible box around similar chunks. When writing code, it is important to use logical arrangement and avoid unneccessary repetition.  Break the html code into logical sections within divs, such as heading or class and then write associated css code to style the sections.
</p>
  <div>
  <h2> Random but Important Facts</h2>
  <p> Google Chrome has a web editor tool that allows you to see the structure and code of a page.  The structure is
    similar to a tree, with a main trunk and branches.  The treelike structure is due to the fact that HTML elements 
    can have elements nested within them.
  </p>

<h1> CSS - Cascading Style Sheet </h1>
<p>Sublime allows you to view both html and css side by side.  Remember they are unique files, and to save
changes in each file.  To open an html file in a web browser, simply double click the file and open in Google
Chrome.  To view changes made in the html in Sublime in a web browser, save in Sublime and then hit refresh
on the web browser. 
</p>
</div>
  <div class ="lesson3structure">
  <h2> The Box Model</h2>
  <p>HTML elements are boxes and each box has four components which are Margin, Border, Padding and Content.
  Box sizes don't have to be in pixels, they can be expressed in percentages also.  If set as a percentage, the size will
  change depending on how big the screen is.  Or, can set the box sizing attribute to border box for 
  each element. CSS is very powerful in allowing element positioning, but it is very complex to understand. Flexbox is one method (see instructor notes). 
  Divs are block elements (not inline) so they take up the entire width of a page by default.  By adding rules, can
  override this behavior and let the divs appear side by side.'
